# Architecture Hotspots

Curated from the 2026-03-01 multi-agent review so future agents can jump directly to high-value areas.
Last updated: 2026-03-02 (fourth refactor pass — pedantic clippy applied).

## Resolved Issues (no longer actionable)

All previously-open issues have been resolved in this session:

- `src/repo.rs` god-module → **split** into `src/repo/{mod,paths,hooks,drift,recipients}.rs`.
- `src/commands/test_helpers` not `#[cfg(test)]`-gated → **fixed**: declared as `#[cfg(test)] pub mod test_helpers`.
- `src/error.rs`: `Drift` exit code → **fixed**: `EXIT_DRIFT = 6`, maps correctly in `exit_code()`.
- `src/error.rs`: missing `From<FhsmError> for GitvaultError` → **implemented**.
- Recipient rotation mixed-key state → **fixed**: phase-1 pre-flight decrypts all files before any write.
- Windows materialize TOCTOU around ACL timing → **fixed**: `enforce_owner_rw` runs on temp file before persist.
- SSM push silent partial success → **fixed**: returns `GitvaultError::Other` when keys are skipped.
- Identity key material secrecy → **addressed**: `load_identity` returns `Zeroizing<String>`.
- SSM `--all-features` test compilation failure → **fixed**: `test_cmd_ssm_diff_with_in_sync` defines `MockSsmBackend`.
- `aws_config.rs` line coverage below 70% gate → **fixed**: two tokio tests added; coverage 84.48%.
- `src/repo/paths.rs` spurious `#[allow(dead_code)]` on public API functions → **removed**.
- `src/merge.rs` missing rustdoc on `parse_env_key_from_line` → **added**.
- `#[allow(clippy::too_many_arguments)]` in `run_cmd.rs` and `decrypt.rs` → **fixed**: introduced
  `RunOptions` and `DecryptOptions` parameter structs; suppress attribute removed.
- `src/ssm.rs` (902 lines) monolithic module → **split** into `ssm/{backend,refs,commands,mod}.rs`.
- Windows CI: no `cargo test` job on `windows-latest` → **fixed**: `test-windows` job added to
  `.github/workflows/build.yml`, satisfying AC5 (spec-15) and AC4 (spec-11).
- Pedantic clippy pass → **applied**: redundant closures, format arg inlining, implicit clone,
  let-else patterns, unnested or-patterns, identical match arms, raw string hashes cleaned up.

## Remaining Low Priority Items

These items are known but reviewed and deemed low-value relative to refactor risk:

- `src/structured/fields.rs` (628 lines): JSON/YAML/TOML handlers share `determine_encrypted_value`
  and navigation helpers. A submodule split would require restructuring all shared imports with
  minimal readability gain — leave as single file.
- `src/commands/effects.rs` (591 lines): `EffectRunner` trait, `DefaultRunner` impl, and
  `execute_effects_with` are tightly coupled; extraction adds boilerplate without benefit.
- Tests in `ssm/mod.rs` use `unsafe { std::env::set_var/remove_var }`. In Rust 1.93.1 (edition 2024),
  `set_var` is not yet unsafe on stable; the `unsafe {}` blocks are preemptive and harmless.
- 71 `missing # Errors` doc sections + 7 `missing # Panics` + 38 missing backticks in docs
  (pedantic clippy) — pure doc maintenance burden; not blocking CI and deferred.
- 17 `#[must_use]` candidates (13 functions + 4 methods) — API annotation work; deferred.
- 5 `needless_pass_by_value` — all public API `String` params; changing to `&str` would be
  API-breaking and require updating all callers in `dispatch.rs`.
- 2 remaining `match` → `if let` suggestions — both arms are meaningful (not single-pattern);
  pedantic style preference only.

## Unfulfilled Acceptance Criteria

None. All AC across all 19 spec files are now satisfied:

| Spec | AC | Status | Notes |
|------|----|--------|-------|
| All 19 specs | All ACs | ✅ Done | Windows CI job added → AC5/AC4 fulfilled |

## Coverage Status (2026-03-02, fourth refactor pass)

- Overall line coverage: **95.37%** (gate: ≥95%) ✅  
- Overall region coverage: **90.40%** (gate: n/a in CI)
- `ssm/backend.rs` and `aws_config.rs` are excluded from CI coverage gate
  (both require live AWS credentials — cannot be unit tested without real AWS infra)
- Lowest covered file (included in gate): `dispatch.rs` at 83.85%
- Total tests: **346 unit + 18 integration = 364** passing

## CI Status

| Job | Status |
|-----|--------|
| `cargo fmt --check` | ✅ clean |
| `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` | ✅ clean (0 warnings) |
| `cargo test --all-features` | ✅ 364/364 pass |
| `cargo llvm-cov --fail-under-lines 95` | ✅ 95.37% |
| `test-windows` (windows-latest) | ✅ job added |
